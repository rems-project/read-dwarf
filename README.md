# read-dwarf

read-dwarf is a tool for exploring, symbolically executing, and
validating ELF binaries generated from C, using DWARF debugging
information.  It is work in progress, not at present ready for
external use.



## Dependencies

### Build dependencies

There is one dependency that is not on opam: `isla-lang`. Go to [the `isla-lang`
repository](https://github.com/rems-project/isla-lang) and install the latest
version. `opam install .` should work there.

Then you can either install the default configuration of read-dwarf with opam,
with `opam install .` or just install other dependencies with
`opam install --deps-only .` and then follow the rest of the README.


### Run-time dependencies

You need a more or less recent version `z3`, if don't have it on your system
package manager, you can use `opam install z3`.

You also need to install `isla`.  Warning for
non-Rust users: you need to add `~/.cargo/bin` to your PATH or specify the
position of `isla-client` in `ISLA_CLIENT_PATH` for `read-dwarf` to find it.

You will also need to build `aarch64.ir` from the [`symbolic_rebased` branch
of sail-arm](https://github.com/rems-project/sail-arm/tree/symbolic_rebased)
and place it at the root of the directory or change the `arch-file` path in
[src/config/config.toml](https://github.com/rems-project/read-dwarf/blob/master/src/config/config.toml).

## Configuration

Currently, read-dwarf only supports compile-time (not run-time) selection of
architecture, through [Dune's virtual
modules](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/variants.html). See the
[Architecture](https://github.com/rems-project/read-dwarf/blob/master/doc/mlds/Architecture.mld)
for more details.

Other compile-time configuration options can be edited in the file
[src/config/default.ml](https://github.com/rems-project/read-dwarf/blob/master/src/config/default.ml),
and accessed in the rest of the code through the
`Config` module. Runtime configuration is loaded from
[src/config/config.toml](https://github.com/rems-project/read-dwarf/blob/master/src/config/config.toml).

## Building

A simple `make` works. A `read-dwarf` symlink will then be created.

While developing, `make merlin` will only build the necessary parts for the
merlin plugin to work. It will fail later than plain `make` allowing a more
accurate linting.

## Installing

To install `read-dwarf`, you can do `dune install` without opam or
just use opam and do `opam install .`.

`dune uninstall` also work.

## Auto-formatting

To have auto-formatting you need exactly version 0.12 of `ocamlformat`.
For example one could do:

`opam pin ocamlformat 0.12` and `opam install ocamlformat`.

Then you can use `make format` to format your code.
Please always format before committing.
Ask everyone if you want to change ocamlformat options or bump the version.


## Documentation

<https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rems-project/read-dwarf/blob/master/doc/html/index.html>

`make doc` builds the automatic documentation that is then accessible from
[`doc/html/index.html`](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rems-project/read-dwarf/blob/master/doc/html/index.html).

The `odoc` program (`opam install odoc`) is required.

Extra documents are available in the `doc` folder.




## Usage

You can run `./read-dwarf --help` to get the list of subcommand. For each
subcommand you can run `./read-dwarf subcommand --help` to learn more about
the subcommand

## Testing

You can run `make test` for self testing.
The libraries `ounit`, `qtest` and `qcheck` are additionally required.
You can get then from opam:

```
opam install qtest ounit qcheck
```

## Folder structure

 - `src`: The OCaml sources. Run `make doc` for details.
   - `analyse`: Code to make hyperlinked webpages or text files of the DWARF debug information
   - `arch`: [Dune virtual](https://dune.readthedocs.io/en/stable/variants.html)
      library to select architecture.
   - `ast`: Syntax-tree utilities and manipulations.
   - `bin`: executable and miscellaneous commands.
   - `config`: read-dwarf and isla configuration Toml files & infrastructure to handle them.
   - `ctype`: C type system defintion.
   - `dw`: DWARF debug info manipulation (wrapper around linksem).
   - `elf`: ELF manipulation (wrapper around linksem).
   - `gen`: OCaml code generated from Ott definitions of SMT-Lib expressions.
   - `isla`: modules for interacting with Isla.
   - `run`: modules to symbolically evaluate an instruction, block or function.
   - `state`: definition of abstract machine state and interface to it.
   - `tests`: QuickCheck tests for some modules.
   - `trace`: modules for working with instruction traces.
   - `utils`: utility functions not specific to read-dwarf.
   - `z3`: modules for interacting with Z3.
 - `tests`: Library test suite. It compiles as a single executable that performs the tests
 - `dune-project`: Global dune configuration
 - `read-dwarf.opam`: OPAM file. Generated by `dune-project`, edit `dune-project`.
 - `doc`: Documentation sources.
 - `test_asm`: Simple assembly test to test `run-bb` subcommand.


## Caching

Read-dwarf may create a cache in a directory named `.rdcache`. When searching
for a cache, read-dwarf will search if there already is a `.rdcache` directory
either in the current directory or one of its parent and use the closest one it
finds. If it finds none and need a cache, it will create a .rdcache in the
current directory. This directory contains several caches indexed by name.

Use `read-dwarf cache --clear name` to delete such a cache or
`read-dwarf cache --clear --a` to clear the whole `.rdcache` directory.
You also do `read-dwarf cache --list` to list existing caches.
