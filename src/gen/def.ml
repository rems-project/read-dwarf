(** Generic empty type. This kind of type
    is explained {{:http://caml.inria.fr/pub/docs/manual-ocaml/emptyvariants.html}here}.
    In particular, when this type appear in a match case,
    the match case can contain a refutation pattern [.] to indicate that this impossible.

    A refutation pattern also work with higher-level constructors, for example in this case:
    {[
    type a = A of int | B of no * int
    let f : a -> int = function
      | A i -> i
      | B _ -> .
    ]}

    It also work in product types:

    {[ let f : no * int -> unit = function _ -> . ]}

    However it doesn't work for sum types: the [no] type need to appear directly in the pattern:
    {[
    type complex_empty = A of no | B of no
    let f : complex_empty = function _ -> . (* does not compile *)
    let f : complex_empty = function A _ | B _ -> . (* compiles *)
    ]}

    In case this behavior is needed, there {!Ast.destr} in {!Ast}. See this
    section to see how they are used. *)
