(** This module add the [run-instr] sub command.

    This subcommand is about testing the various operations that can happen
    in an instruction processing. This is not [isla-test],
    the instructions will always be fetched from the cache and use {!Init}.
    If this fail at an earlier point, use [isla-test] to debug the Isla pipeline

    Additionally [run-instr] supports branching instructions.
*)

(* Possible options

   - Use {!Trace} or not
   - -no-run (just dump trace)
   - final State simplification
   - [Trace] simplification
   - Possible dumps :
     - Preprocessed Trace
     - Register types
     - Trace.t
     - Initial State after Init
     - Final State before Simp
     - Final State after Simp
