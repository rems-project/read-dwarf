(** This module provide the program runner that caches all the information
    required to make a state transition

    Later this module will handle inlining in a transparent way, and
    may also compress basic block traces (We'll need to check this is okay with type inference)

    For now this module load instructions on a per-symbol basis, and do not
    try to load instructions outside of function symbol. TODO: remove this restriction.

    The final goal of this module is to encode all necessary information to perform a
    state transition. In particular, the {!run} function should never require more
    argument: If extra information is required, it should be part of the runner if
    it is dependent on the whole program or in the state if it is specific to the state.
