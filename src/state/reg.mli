(** This module handle the register abstraction.

    A register is defined by a {!Path} and a type {!ty}. The path is a
    representation of dot separated list of identifiers.

    Registers are not part of the {!Arch} module because they are discovered
    dynamically. This module keeps a global index of all register of the current
    architecture (in a {!Utils.IdMap}). This map also fix the types of registers.

    This allow to represent registers as integer everywhere.

    The module also provides {!Map} and {!PMap} a respectively full and partial
    maps over registers. They need special support (especially the full map)
    because new registers may be added at any time after the creation of the map.

    TODO: Support sail vectors (A path will be of type (string + int) list) *)

(** {1 Register map }

    To achieve a partial map on register, one may just used a plain [Hashtbl].
    However as register is a finite type one may want to have a map where all the
    register are bound and thus access to a bound value cannot fail. This is
    complicated by the fact that new registers can be added after the creation of
    the map. To handle all those subtleties, there is the {!Utils.Map} module.*)

(** This module provide a full map over register in the same way than {!Utils.FullVec}
    provide a map of integers. It still need a generator to generate the value
    bound to not-yet-added registers.

    Because the domain of registers is finite, some extra function are available
    like {!iter} and {!iteri} that are not possible in {!Utils.FullVec}.

    If a register is added with {!add}, it is automatically and implicitly added
    to the {!Utils.Map} and the generator must accept this new value. The generator
    will never be called on invalid register values (i.e. when the generator is
    called on a register, the former can get the latter's type and name with
    {!reg_type} and {!to_string}) *)
module Map : sig
  type reg = t

  (** The type of the complete map *)
  type 'a t

  (** Initialize the map with a generator *)
  val init : (reg -> 'a) -> 'a t

  (** Clear the map and restart with this generator *)

  val copy : 'a t -> 'a t

  (** Set the value of a register *)
  val set : 'a t -> reg -> 'a -> unit

  (** Get the value of a register *)
  val get : 'a t -> reg -> 'a

  (** Map the function all the registers (including future, not yet added ones) *)
  val map : ('a -> 'b) -> 'a t -> 'b t

  (** Map the function on all the register by mutation (including future ones) *)
  val map_mut : ('a -> 'a) -> 'a t -> unit

  (** Map the function on all current register. Future registers are unchanged *)
  val map_mut_current : ('a -> 'a) -> 'a t -> unit

  (** Iterate over all the value of all currently present registers *)
  val iter : ('a -> unit) -> 'a t -> unit

  (** Same as {!iter} but also with the register index *)
  val iteri : (reg -> 'a -> unit) -> 'a t -> unit

  (** Give all the registers bindings *)
  val bindings : 'a t -> (reg * 'a) list

  (** Contrary to {!Utils.FullVector.pp}, this one will print the binding of all registers,
      and may call the generator to do that *)
  val pp : ('a -> Pp.document) -> 'a t -> Pp.document
