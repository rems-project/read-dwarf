    This provide a semantic view of sums as list of terms and conversion

*)

    Any expression [e] should have the same semantic meaning as [Typed.sum (split e)].

    TODO I need to sort according to an arbitrary order to be able to compare reliably.
    This will probably be part of a more general simplifier work.*)
