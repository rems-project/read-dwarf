(** This module represent architectural locations. Locations in DWARF
    information are represented as a little stack language (represented as
    {!dwop}[ list]) which describes how to compute the target value from the
    current concrete state. This computation can be arbitrarily complex, for
    example take half of the value from the high bits of a register and then the
    other half from memory at a specific address coming from another register.

    Those expression are not directly usable to guide the type inference, as
    we would much more like simple direct information like "This value is in that
    register". To solve this, there is a custom type {!t} that interpret simple
    static locations directly and leaves more complex location uninterpreted.

    This interpretation is currently very basic. It remains to be seen if it
    actually need to be improved.*)
