(** This module provide a caching system for isla trace on top of {!Server}.

    It uses the cache named "isla" of {!Cache}

    Call {!start} to start and {!stop}. Do not interact directly with the {!Server}
    if you use the cache.

    You can use {!ensure_started} to force the {!Server} to start but you probably
    shouldn't do that. By the default the {!Server} is only started if the traces
    of an instruction are required and not in the cache.
