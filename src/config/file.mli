    For now I expect a TOML format and use the [toml] library from opam. The data structure
    themselves are format agnostic so if we change the TOML library of change of format, only this
    file must be modified. For example to JSON or YAML.

    The top level usage is to first set the {!file} reference which will be done by
    {!CommonOpt.config} using {!ensure_loaded}.
    Then the config can be accessed with the various {!section:acc}
