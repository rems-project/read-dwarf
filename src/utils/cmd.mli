(**
   This module provides high-level interaction with external processes.

   This provide a functionality similar to
   {{:https://erratique.ch/software/bos/doc/Bos.html}[Bos])}, but this lib is still unstable.

   There are two main mode of communication provided:
    - Interaction with pipes: capture the stdin or stdout of the command and use them
    - Interaction with socket: Create a socket on which the child program can connect to.

   Programs can be launched in two modes
    - Calling: They are called like a function and we wait for them to give a result
      before contnuing
    - Server: The are launch as a background process that stay there and can be called.

   Calling programs can be done with [call*] function like {!call}, {!call_read},
   {!call_send} and {!call_send_read} and only support pipe interaction

   Server like setups can be done in pipe mode with {!IOServer} and in socket mode with
   {!SocketServer}.
