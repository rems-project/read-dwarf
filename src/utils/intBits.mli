(** Manipulate an int as bitfield of size 31 or 63.

    I'm tired of having to think about bit shifts and bitwise operations when I do that stuff

    Little endian indexing (0 is the least significant bit)

    Ranges are specified with and index and a length. The index must be in [\[0,length)] and the
    length must be in [(0,length\]]. Those conditions will be named "valid range".
    Any range specified in that way can go after the end.
    When reading, it will behave as if it was zeroes,
    and on writes, all bits after the end are discarded.

    All unsafe function implicitely assume that all indexes and ranges are valid.
    All safe functions throw if those conditions are not met.
