(** This module provide some [Cmdliner] helper functions. *)

open Cmdliner

(** Return a unit [Term] that evaluates the input term and
    set the reference to the resulting value.

    Due to the nature of Cmdliner, this may be evaluated multiple times, so
    setting the reference to anything else is dangerous.
*)

(** Add an unit term that need to be evaluated at the same time at the main term.

    The order of evaluation is unspecified, but the option will be evaluated
    before the resulting term is returned.
*)

(** Fold add_option on a list of option *)

(** Replaces Term.const but allow a unit terms (like the one generated by {!setter}) to
    be evaluated before the function is called *)
