(** A module giving a map indexing data with address ranges and providing access
    to quick access to data corresponding to any value in-between.

    Each address is bound to at most one object so the ranges are not allowed to
    overlap.

    In practice you dont specify the range. The size of the bound range is
    provided by the stored object itself that is assumed to have a length. The
    stored object must thus provide a [len] function as specfified by the
    {!LenObject} signature. However a length can be added to any {!Object} using
    {!PairLenObject}

    An important remark is that maps are perfectly allowed to have negative
    addresses, and will considered negative integer as negative addresses. An
    object of size 7 starting at -4 will end at 3

    For now, this has a pure immutable interface.*)

(** An integer map: [Map.Make(Int)] *)
module IMap = Map.Make (Int)

  val at_opt : t -> int -> obj option

  (** Get the object containing the address and the offset of the address inside the object

      {[at_off map addr = (obj, off) ]}

      means:

      {v
         |                      |           |         |
       map 0                 obj start    point    obj end

                                |<------len obj------>|
      v}

      In other words, [at_off] allow a change of coordinate from the map frame to the
      object frame.
