(** A full vector is a vector in which all non-negative integer are bound.

    This consist in a normal vector and a function and all the bindings of value after
    the vector end are the result of the function call on that integer.

    It is guaranted that the function will be called lazily on integer when required
    in stricly increasing order (and thus never twice on the same integer).
    However an integer may be skipped (When manually set). That means the function can have
    side effect if necessary. However if the structure is copied ({!map} or {!copy}),
    The generator may be called multiple time on some integer in the different copies.

    Both set and get may generate calls to the generator if required.

    Any attempt to use a negative integer will raise [Invalid_argument].

    A negative integer will never be passed to the generator.
