    If it is simple, we record whether a branch is conditional (and so can
    fall-through to the next instruction) or unconditional and its target
    address to help construct the (simple) comes-before relation later. *)

    Address a comes-before address b iff a falls-through and/or branches to b.
    NOTE: The graph of this relation can be be cyclic.
    NOTE: It ignores the fact that BLR instructions effectively fall-through. *)

    where the key is the address of instructions that load from a stack-offset
    that was spilled-to earlier and the value is the address of that earlier spill.
    NOTE: This is an over-approximation: it will track all register spills but may
    also include standard stack/local variable manipulation.
    NOTE: Does NOT do/use any sort of pointer-aliasing analysis, just syntactic
    pattern-matching. *)
